title: Tabular data to RDF tutorial available
---

We have created a tutorial showing [conversion of tabular data to RDF](/tutorials/csv-to-rdf/), including all transformations and metadata necessary to publish a LOD dataset.
The tutorial is based on real-world data of the [Local Administrative Units (LAU)](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/local-administrative-units) code list.
